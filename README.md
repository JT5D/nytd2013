# nytd2013

This project was created for [Tech Crunch Disrupt NY Hackathon 2013](http://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-ny-hackathon-2013/event-info/).

To use your Times Developer Network API Key with the presentation links and sample app:

1. Go to [developer.nytimes.com/register](http://developer.nytimes.com/apps/register) and get a key for the Article Search API
2. Open nytd2013/index.html in your browser
3. Press down and click on the API Key link

## About the presentation

This presentation was built using Hakim El Hattab's amazing [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) framework.  It's awesome, and it's free!

## About the sample application

The sample application is a small port of an internal search portal tool.  It should give you a good idea of how to make use of all the features of the Article Search API, piece by piece.  It's built using Twitter's slick [bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap) CSS framework, and of course [jquery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery).  If it weren't for both, my applications would look like an engineer designed them. -JB 4/25/2013
